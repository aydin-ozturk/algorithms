# Below The Arithmetical Mean
# When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original list’s arithmetical mean.
# The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
# Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]

def below_arithmetical_mean(array):
    below = []
    for i in array:
        if i < sum(array) / len(array):
            below.append(i)
    return below


# Two Lowest Elements
# When given a list of elements, find the two lowest elements.
# They can be equal to each other or different.
# Example: [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2], Return: 2, 3

def two_lowest_elements(array):
    return sorted(array)[:2]
